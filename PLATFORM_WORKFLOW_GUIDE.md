## ðŸ”§ **Data Persistence Fix**

The issue you're experiencing is likely due to month filtering. Here's what should happen:

1. **When you enter budget data**: It saves to database with current month/year
2. **When you navigate away and back**: It should retrieve data for current month
3. **If no data shows**: The month filter might be wrong

### **Quick Fix Steps**:
1. Check what month/year you're viewing (top of budget page)
2. Make sure it matches when you entered the data
3. Try changing the month selector to see your data
4. Data should persist across all navigation
